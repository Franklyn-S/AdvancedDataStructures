# AdvancedDataStructures
This repository was created to hold Assignments from CKP8077 - Advanced Data Sctructures at UFC.


Credits to https://www.programiz.com/dsa/red-black-tree to help implementing the standart red-black-tree.

I added the persistency as the assignment asked for it.

To compile on windows: g++ -o RedBlackTree.exe RedBlackTree.cpp -g && ./RedBlackTree.exe

To compile on linux/mac: g++ -o RedBlackTree.out RedBlackTree.cpp -g && ./RedBlackTree.out
